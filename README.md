# Kaggle
My Jupyter notebooks for Kaggle exercises

# Usage
Download the kaggle datasets of the desired folder in data/. Each folder contains a few images for validation and testing for convenience. I will try to add model parameters to a .bc bcolz file in the future. For redux, I only saved it as the default save_weights .h5, which is unfortunately much too large for uploading.

# Results
Redux: Top 1/3, with log loss of 0.09998.
